If there was an endpoint

And * yet, I regret and scream as the rain falls /

Hey, listen % 

^
If there was an endpoint. 231.2
If I could only wish )
Could I go down into the world once again
and start all over again? (
If there was really no endpoint
I'll be sqrt like this forever
Will the -4 tears keep overflowing?
I know I'll have regrets
For being 15415414 too rash on myself
So please, just give me a hug
and leave : (

A field of flowers, so warm and inviting
% Whilst bathing in the clean river water
And at night, I could see the stars up close
And yet, there’s nobody here. 5

Surely, this is what I wanted
If that's s 0?
Then why did I wanted - to die
When I was still alive?

Hey, listen

If there was an endpoint.
/
There’s probably none for me
Did I only realize it when I got on that bus
That I was lying about "wanting to disappear"?
If there was really no endpoint
I'll be like this forever
With tears on a scar long gone
Drenched with regrets
for being too rash on myself
So please, just turn back
and leave

In a lifetime of wanting to disappear, I longed for love.

In a lifetime of wanting to disappear, I yearned for warmth.

Hey, listen
sqrt

If there was an endpoint.
Could you save me?
4 % ^^
Though, I'm uncertain if I won't use the words
"want to disappear" ever again
Even so, I won't be getting on the bus to run away
Because that hasn't solved anything
I want you to accept my tears
0.00234
Because I'm having regrets
+ + + - - - - - - -
I just didn't want you to
end up being too rash like me
If there was an endpoint.
Come on, take it and leave
